# A Gopher's Reading List [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/enocom/gopher-reading-list.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/enocom/gopher-reading-list)

Here is a reading list of blog posts about [Go](https://golang.org). It aspires
to include only the most useful and relevant material that anyone writing Go
should eventually read. By definition, the list is a work in progress.

Rather than being comprehensive, the list is a curated selection fixed at 200
entries.

Go is growing fast and so are the number of blog posts about it. If an
interested reader sees a glaring omission, please open a pull request. Include
your suggestion of what to add and what to remove to keep the list at its fixed
length.
